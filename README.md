# Italy's Food Industry Waste 3D Maps

This repository contains a collection of 3D maps that show the amount of waste generated by Italy's food industry in different regions of the country. The maps are based on data collected by the Italian Ministry of Environment and Protection of Land and Sea.

The maps were created using Pydeck, a Python library for creating interactive maps and visualizations. The Pydeck code used to generate each map is stored in the "3dmaps" folder of this repository, along with the HTML files that display the maps.

To view the maps, simply navigate to the Netlify site URL associated with this repository. The "index.html" file in the root of the repository displays all of the available maps in iframes.

Feel free to use and modify the code and maps in this repository for your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
